# Smart India Hackathon 2025 Submission
## Problem Title:
Create a Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH.

## Objective:
To develop an interactive web platform that simulates a herbal garden virtually, letting users explore, learn, and understand the medicinal plants used in traditional Indian medicine systems such as Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy.

## Key Features of the Virtual Herbal Garden:
## Feature	Description:
3D Plant Models	Users can rotate, zoom, and view 3D plant models from all angles
Plant Info Cards	Botanical names, common names, region, uses, and cultivation methods
Multimedia Learning	Images, audio guides, explainer videos, traditional usage visuals
Search & Filter	By use-case (immunity, skin), by region, or plant name
Virtual Tours	Themed walkthroughs for specific healing systems (e.g., Digestive Tour)
User Tools	Bookmark plants, take personal notes, and share knowledge on social media
Admin Tools	Secure dashboard for content management and updates

Unique features include an AI-powered herbal assistance chatbot to answer user queries, an augmented reality option to scan real-world plants and access detailed 3D models, and a notes section with bookmarking and sharing capabilities. Users can also engage with the community through a comment section to share experiences, remedies, and traditional knowledge. This project promotes health and wellness by providing in-depth knowledge of medicinal plants, empowering users to explore natural remedies and integrate traditional herbal practices into their daily lives.
